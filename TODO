* Set a flag to indicate that MySQL timezone information is out of date.
* Only remove this flag when the timezones have been successfully updated.
* If MySQL isn't running do not use the bootstrap option, instead check for
  this flag when MySQL next starts from debian-start This could be
  implemented by adding a /etc/mysql/debian-start.d hook directory
  to mysql-server packages.
