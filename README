This package installs a trigger on tzdata's zoneinfo files.

When tzdata is updated, this package will load the updated timezone
information into MySQL, which stores this information in internal
timezone tables.

This can manually be done using mysql_tzinfo_to_sql, but thanks
to this trigger this package keeps MySQL in sync with tzdata.

If MySQL is running this will be done by connecting as the
debian-sys-maint user. If MySQL is not running then it will be
run using the bootstrap option while the timezones are loaded.
